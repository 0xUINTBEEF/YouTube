### Before submitting:
Thanks for coming & caring! Sometime 3 words are enough of a bug report. But please check if the issue has already been reported ever.  That might inspire you to post different words there.  
(With [GitHub's issue search (use this link)](https://github.com/ImprovedTube/ImprovedTube/issues?q=) (else removing "is:issue is:open" from the standard search)  
<!-- ( If it was posted before, you can answer/react there to give it your voice and move it up in the lists) 
         If the status is  "closed" (=fixed) recently, then Web Stores can be updated soon)
         If  it was closed month or years ago, then it might reappeared & must be fixed again.) --> 

### Optional:
 - Expected /preferred behavior: 
 - ImprovedTube Version (Extension popup after closing Search, chrome:extensions, about:addons):
 - Tested as only active extension or in incognito mode?:
 - Settings, attach/paste from menu or console:
     - [Hamburger menu] -> [Settings] -> [Backup & reset] -> [Export settings] (can ommit Blocklist and Analyzer)
     - Console/DevTools execute `(function({analyzer, blocklist, ...a}){return JSON.stringify(a)})(ImprovedTube.storage)`

   <!-- Many thanks & smiles !  -->
